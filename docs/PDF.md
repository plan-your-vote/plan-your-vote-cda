# PDF Generation

# Library used: [rkusa/pdfjs](https://github.com/rkusa/pdfjs)

The documentation of the library can be found [here] (https://github.com/rkusa/pdfjs/tree/master/docs)

The component for the PDF generator can be found `src/components/PDF`

Since there were different headers for different pages, the code generates three pdfs and merges them together.* 

## Note :
* Currently the Logo on the pdf is being pulled from a file in the codebase but it can be fetched from a link as well
* The first page of the pdf is hard-coded for now
